#### [S3 Encryption at Rest Does NOT Solve for Bucket Negligence - Last Week in AWS](https://www.lastweekinaws.com/blog/s3-encryption-at-rest-does-not-solve-for-bucket-negligence/)
Blog post does a good job describing what encryption at rest gets you and why having it enabled is good, but not a panacea.  While directed specifically at S3, this applies to pretty much any service that offers encryption at rest.

#### [Parse, donâ€™t validate - Alexis King](https://lexi-lambda.github.io/blog/2019/11/05/parse-don-t-validate/)
Some good food for thought on validation, type safety, application design, and composition.  A little hard to read since the examples are in Haskell, but the lessons apply as much to non-functional programming languages as the functional ones.  Worth a read for the concept of "shotgun parsing" if nothing else.

## Tools
#### [CDK Nag - CDK Labs at AWS](https://github.com/cdklabs/cdk-nag)
Tooling to check CDK or CloudFormation templates for best practices, officially published by AWS.  Customizable, but includes checks for NIST, PCI DSS, and HIPAA out of the box -- very nice!

## Just for fun
#### [faces.js](https://zengm.com/facesjs/)
Library that creates programmatically generated faces; very fun just to mess around with and see what you can make via the face editor.  Similar vibe as Nintendo's Mii avatars.
